# Internet_Protocol_Design

This project is based on the implementation of SCTP and DCCP protocol used into a server-client connection. The
two concepts are implemented using Python in the same mindset, with the client asking for a .html page over HTTP
with a GET request, and the server sending the file over the respective protocol. We will discuss the code mainly, and
parts of the implementations that are the same on both SCTP and DCCP - mainly the HTTP handling part - will be
discussed only in the SCTP section
